module Ooor

  # Meta data shared across sessions, a cache of the data in ir_model in OpenERP.
  # in Activerecord, ModelSchema is a module and its properties are carried by the
  # ActiveRecord object. But in Ooor we don't want do do that because the Ooor::Base
  # object is different for each session, so instead we delegate the schema
  # properties to some ModelSchema instance that is shared between sessions, 
  # reused accross workers in a multi-process web app (via memcache for instance).
